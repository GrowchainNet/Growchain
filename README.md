## Growchain.net - The world's first public chain built for children

Growchain is a decentralized and trustfree maternal-child care application platform based on blockchain technology. It is also the world¡¯s first public chain built for children. Growchain is designed to subvert the traditional rules of the maternal-child care industry and build a brand new ecology that is safe, fair, reliable, and dedicated to the global maternal-child care industry.

In this new ecology, blockchain technology will be used to reshape the trust mechanism of the entire maternal-child industry. Blockchain features such as distributed data storage and programmability will be fully applied to product traceability, content copyright certification, big data sharing, and other aspects in the maternal-child industry market, so as to achieve the complete eradication of data fraud, false propaganda, and other issues, which will break the development barrier from industry monopoly for small and medium-sized high-quality brands.
